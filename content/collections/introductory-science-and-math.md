Some of OCW’s most widely used courses are introductions to science and math, which together form MIT's [Science Core](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/science-core/). These foundational subjects in calculus, physics, chemistry, and biology are a key part of MIT’s [General Institute Requirements (GIR)](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/) for all undergraduate students.

MIT offers several related but varied treatments of each subject, in order to match the learner's particular interests and level of preparation. There is more than one way to learn these key concepts, for instance with differing emphasis on theory or on real-world applications, and so OCW shares some of the varied treatments offered at MIT.

**Mathematics**

The Mathematics GIR is a sequence of two subjects, Single Variable Calculus and Multivariable Calculus, as described in the following video. (This video is from [MIT Department of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/@MITDepartmentofMathematics) on YouTube and is not covered by our [Creative Commons license](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc).)

Most MIT students take the standard versions of these subjects, 18.01 and 18.02, such as the following:

- [18.01SC Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)
- [18.02SC Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)

Other versions of [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics&q=18.01) and [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics&q=18.02) are also available on OCW. 

**Physics**

The Physics GIR is a sequence of two subjects, Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism, as described in the following video. (This video is from [MIT Department of Physics](https://www.youtube.com/@MITDepartmentofPhysics) on YouTube and is not covered by our [Creative Commons license](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc).)

- [8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/)

Other versions of [Classical Mechanics](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Physics&q=8.01) and [Electricity and Magnetism](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Physics&q=8.02) are also available on OCW.

**Chemistry**

Any one of three subjects satisfies the Chemistry GIR, as described in the following video. (This video is from [MIT Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE)](https://www.youtube.com/@mitmaterialsscienceandengi5332) on YouTube and is not covered by our [Creative Commons license](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc).)

{{< resource uuid="18fc57b5-8407-442b-80e8-75e49a182520" >}}

The Department of Chemistry offers two subjects:

- [5.111SC Principles of Chemical Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/)

The Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers this subject: 

- [3.091 Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2018/), which assumes some background in high school chemistry and emphasizes the application of chemistry in materials.

Other versions of [Principles of Chemical Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-111-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2008/) and [Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091sc-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2010/) are also available on OCW.

**Biology**

The Biology GIR, Introductory Biology, is described in the following video.  (This video is from [MIT Department of Biology](https://www.youtube.com/@mitdepartmentofbiology1187) on YouTube and is not covered by our [Creative Commons license](https://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc).)

{{< resource uuid="a1d8fd73-1cfa-487e-abf3-834f81355426" >}}

Introductory Biology comes in several versions numbered 7.012 through 7.016. All versions cover a common core of topics, as well as distinctive material in each version as described in the [Biology GIR subject options list](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/major-minor-requirements/general-institute-requirement/).

- [7.01SC Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/) is a single course representation created by OCW using selections from several Biology GIR versions.

Other versions of [Introductory Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Biology&q=7.01&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum) are also available on OCW.

Incoming students may prepare for Introductory Biology with the online non-credit course [Pre-7.01: Getting up to Speed in Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-001-pre-7-01-getting-up-to-speed-in-biology-summer-2019/).
