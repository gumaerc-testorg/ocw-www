Are you drawn to business? Thinking about an MBA? With OCW, you can learn alongside the next generation of business leaders studying at MIT.

The [MBA program at MITâ€™s Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/explore-program/mba-curriculum) begins with a collection of courses known as the "first-semester core." Through this shared experience, students gain fundamental skills in six required core courses. Five of these six courses are on OCW and listed below. The sixth required core course, *Leadership Challenges for an Inclusive World*, is not yet on OCW, but learners may find useful materials among many other [leadership courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Sloan%20School%20of%20Management&q=leadership&s=-runs.best_start_date&t=Leadership) on OCW.

Students may also choose one elective from among four options. Three of these four electives are on OCW and listed below. The fourth elective, *Competitive Strategy*, is not yet on OCW, but learners may find useful materials among other business strategy courses such as [15.902 Strategic Management](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-902-strategic-management-i-fall-2006), [15.963 Advanced Strategy](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-963-advanced-strategy-spring-2008), or [15.912 Technology Strategy](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-912-technology-strategy-fall-2008).
