## The 17-year-old student from Spain uses MIT resources to deepen her understanding of math and physics.

Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning

 

Martina Solano Soto is on a mission to pursue her passion for physics and, ultimately, to solve big problems. Since she was a kid, she has had a lot of questions: Why do animals exist? What are we doing here? Why don’t we know more about the Big Bang? And she has been determined to find answers. 

“That’s why I found MIT OpenCourseWare,” says Solano, of Girona, Spain. “When I was 14, I started to browse and wanted to find information that was reliable, dynamic, and updated. I found MIT resources by chance, and it’s one of the biggest things that has happened to me.” 

In addition to OpenCourseWare, which offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 courses that span the MIT undergraduate and graduate curriculum, Solano also took advantage of the MIT Open Learning Library. Part of MIT Open Learning, the library offers free courses and invites people to learn at their own pace while receiving immediate feedback through interactive content and exercises. 

Solano, who is now 17, has studied [quantum physics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/) via OpenCourseWare — also part of MIT Open Learning — and she has taken Open Learning Library courses on [electricity and magnetism](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.02.1x+1T2019/about), [calculus](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.1x+2T2019/about), [quantum computation](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.3x+1T2018/about), and [kinematics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/pages/week-1-kinematics/). She even created her own syllabus, complete with homework, to ensure she stayed on track and kept her goals in mind. Those goals include studying math and physics as an undergraduate. She also hopes to study general relativity and quantum mechanics at the doctoral level. “I really want to unify them to find a theory of quantum gravity,” she says. “I want to spend all my life studying and learning.” 

Solano was particularly motivated by [Barton Zwiebach](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/barton-zwiebach/), professor of physics, whose courses [Quantum Physics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2016/) and [Quantum Physics II](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/) are available on MIT OpenCourseWare. She took advantage of all of the resources that were provided: video lectures, assignments, lecture notes, and exams.  

“I was fascinated by the way he explained. I just understood everything, and it was amazing,” she says. “Then, I learned about his book, 'A First Course in String Theory,' and it was because of him that I learned about black holes and gravity. I’m extremely grateful.” 

While Solano gives much credit to the variety and quality of Open Learning resources, she also stresses the importance of being organized. As a high school student, she has things other than string theory on her mind: her school, extracurriculars, friends, and family.  

For anyone in a similar position, she recommends “figuring out what you’re most interested in and how you can take advantage of the flexibility of Open Learning resources. Is there a half-hour before bed to watch a video, or some time on the weekend to read lecture notes? If you figure out how to make it work for you, it is definitely worth the effort.”  

“If you do that, you are going to grow academically and personally,” Solano says. “When you go to school, you will feel more confident.” 

And Solano is not slowing down. She plans to continue using Open Learning resources, this time turning her attention to graduate-level courses, all in service of her curiosity and drive for knowledge. 

“When I was younger, I read the book 'The God Equation,' by Michio Kaku, which explains quantum gravity theory. Something inside me awoke,” she recalls. “I really want to know what happens at the center of a black hole, and how we unify quantum mechanics, black holes, and general relativity. I decided that I want to invest my life in this.”  

She is well on her way. Last summer, Solano applied for and received a scholarship to study particle physics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. This summer, she’s applying for opportunities to study the cosmos. All of this, she says, is only possible thanks to what she has learned with MIT Open Learning resources. 

“The applications ask you to explain what you like about physics, and thanks to MIT, I’m able to express that,” Solano says. “I’m able to go for these scholarships and really fight for what I dream.”
