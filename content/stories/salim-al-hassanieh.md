## Retired professor Salim Al-Hassanieh has turned to MIT Open Learning’s OpenCourseWare resources for decades, enriching his research and teaching.

Salim Al-Hassanieh has moved a lot over the course of his education and career. Born in Syria, he received his PhD from Université de Rennes in France and taught management sciences, organizational development, and information systems at University of Damascus and institutions in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. These days, he’s retired and divides his time between Syria and Germany. But Al-Hassanieh knows that with MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, you don’t need to move at all to experience American higher education.

“I frequently recommended OpenCourseWare to my students and colleagues, particularly those with international aspirations,” he says. “I often told them, ‘If you want to study in America without leaving your home, go to MIT OpenCourseWare.’”

Al-Hassanieh first remembers becoming aware of MIT and the Sloan School of Management in 1997, when he was researching a book project. Years later, when he was working on another book, “Managing by Creativity,” he revisited MIT and discovered OpenCourseWare.

“When I found OpenCourseWare, I was immediately drawn to the quality, openness, and academic rigor of the platform,” he recalls. “I continue to consult OpenCourseWare regularly and receive its newsletter to this day, at the age of 80 years old.”

He views open education resources as a beacon, saying that they can be a “vital gateway” for learners who may not otherwise have access to educational materials or the ability to travel.

He stresses that it is not just the course content that is so impactful, but also the practical, forward-looking style of instruction. Some lectures, particularly those which emphasize systems thinking, inspired Al-Hassanieh’s own curriculum design and left a lasting impression.

The clear structure and self-paced nature of OpenCourseWare courses helped Al-Hassanieh improve his academic English, which in turn created new publishing opportunities for him and his students. In 2012, he wrote a cultural book in English, “Illuminations on Arab-Islamic Public Administration Contributions,” and, in 2024, wrote an English-Arabic encyclopedic dictionary called “Your Comprehensive Guide to Success in Knowledge Management,” published by the Arab Administrative Development Organization (ARADO).

“My research and my students’ learning journeys benefited from my English language learning,” he says. “I often encouraged my students to use OpenCourseWare not only to deepen their subject knowledge, but also to strengthen their English in an academic context.”

Al-Hassanieh continues to learn from OpenCourseWare — even in retirement. He is actively conducting research, examining ideas relevant to political transitions, especially in the context of Syria. He explores lectures on generative AI and just this year wrote the Arabic-language book “Unlocking the Potential of GAI,” also published by ARADO.

In his retirement, Al-Hassanieh prioritizes hope and peace alongside learning. He spends six months of the year in Berlin to be close to his adult children, who are surgeons there. He follows the news of changing politics in Syria and the world and says, “I hope that resources like OpenCourseWare can continue to showcase a narrative of knowledge sharing and educational empowerment.”
