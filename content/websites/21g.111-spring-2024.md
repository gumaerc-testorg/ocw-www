course_description: "Chinese calligraphy (\u4E66\u6CD5/\u66F8\u6CD5 sh\u016Bf\u01CE\
  )\u2014the art of expressive brush writing\u2014is one of the most esteemed and\
  \ enduring artistic traditions in China. This introductory course invites students\
  \ to explore calligraphy as both a classical discipline and a living art form that\
  \ continues to evolve in contemporary contexts.\n\nThe course integrates technical\
  \ training, historical and cultural study, and reflective practice. Students will\
  \ not only gain hands-on experience with the brush and ink, but also investigate\
  \ the evolving role of calligraphy in Chinese society, from antiquity to the present\
  \ day. Through museum visits, interdisciplinary exploration, and individual projects,\
  \ students will gain a deeper understanding of Chinese culture, philosophy, and\
  \ aesthetic values. A final video project allows students to reflect on their personal\
  \ journey with calligraphy and document their artistic growth.\n\nNo prior knowledge\
  \ of the Chinese language is required."
