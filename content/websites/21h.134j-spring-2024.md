course_description: This course surveys the foundations of material life and changing
  social and economic conditions in medieval Europe in their broader Eurasian context.
  It covers the gradual disintegration of the Roman imperial order, the emergence
  and decline of feudal institutions, the transformation of peasant agriculture, living
  standards and the impact of climate and disease environments, and the ebb and flow
  of long-distance trade across the Eurasian system. There is a particular emphasis
  on the study of those factors, both institutional and technological, which contributed
  to the emergence of capitalist organization and economic growth in western Europe
  in comparison to the trajectories followed by the other major medieval economies.
