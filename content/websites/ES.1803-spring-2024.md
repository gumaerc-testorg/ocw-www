course_description: "This course, taught to students in MIT\u2019s Experimental Study\
  \ Group, is equivalent to the Mathematics Department's [*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/).\
  \ They satisfy the same prerequisites and are geared to preparing students for downstream\
  \ science and engineering classes.\n\nMIT\u2019s [Experimental Study Group](https://esg.mit.edu/)\
  \ (ESG) is one of MIT\u2019s first-year learning communities. Small class sizes\
  \ allow for teaching interactively and staying in close touch with what every student\
  \ is finding easy or difficult."
