course_description: "The course offers an analysis of the keen interest shown by France\
  \ and the French in North American cultures since the 18th century. Not only did\
  \ France contribute to the construction of both Canadian and American nations, but\
  \ it has also constantly delineated its identity by way of praising or criticizing\
  \ North American cultures. Using materials drawn from literature, comics, TV shows,\
  \ and series as well as political debates, the course will historically trace this\
  \ ambivalent relation exploring various themes such as liberalism, entertainment\
  \ and the media, trade and cultural goods, transatlantic intellectual encounters,\
  \ and translation.\n\nThe course is taught entirely in French.\n\nAbout the instructor:\
  \ Bruno Perreau is the Cynthia L. Reed Associate Professor of French Studies at\
  \ MIT. He is also an Affiliate Faculty at the Center for European Studies, Harvard.\
  \ Perreau recently published *The Politics of Adoption: Gender and the Making of\
  \ French Citizenship* (MIT Press, 2014), *Queer Theory: The French Response* (Stanford\
  \ University Press, 2016), *Les D\xE9fis de la R\xE9publique* (ed. with Joan W.\
  \ Scott, Presses de Sciences Po, 2017), *Qui a peur de la th\xE9orie queer ?* (Presses\
  \ de Sciences Po, 2018), *Sph\xE8res d\u2019injustice. Pour un universalisme minoritaire*\
