course_description: 'This introductory course exposes students to modern programming
  methods and techniques used in practice by physical scientists today. Emphasis is
  placed on code design, algorithm development/verification, and comparative advantages/disadvantages
  of different languages (including Python, Julia, and C/C++) and tools (including
  Jupyter, machine learning from data or models, and cloud and high-performance computing
  workflows). Students are introduced to and work with common programming tools, types
  of problems, and techniques for solving a variety of data-analytic and equation-modeling
  scenarios from real research: examination visualization techniques; basic numerical
  analysis; methods of dissemination and verification; and practices for reproducible
  work, version control, documentation, and sharing/publication.'
