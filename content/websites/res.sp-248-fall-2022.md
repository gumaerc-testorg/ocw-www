course_description: This subject gives first-year students a unique opportunity to
  explore the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program while acquiring
  valuable problem-solving skills. It introduces students to the NEET Ways of Thinking,
  which are cognitive approaches for tackling complex challenges, valued by industry
  and for thriving in an uncertain and rapidly changing world. Student teams will
  engage in challenge-based learning in interdisciplinary engineering education via
  the NEET program threads. Student teams will learn how to apply various Ways of
  Thinking for solving these challenges, including practical methods and tools which
  they can later use at MIT and beyond.
