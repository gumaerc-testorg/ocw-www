course_description: This course presents the fundamentals of tissue engineering (TE)
  and organ regeneration (OR). Emphasis is on clinical translation and the development
  of workable medical devices. Topics include factors that prevent the spontaneous
  regeneration of tissues/organs in the adult (following traumatic injury, surgical
  excision, disease, and aging), and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that can
  identify the agents to employ therapeutically to enable induced regeneration. A
  principal focus is the assessment of the criteria that need to be met by biomaterials
  to deliver these agents and to fill defects. The course presents the principles
  underlying strategies for employing select biomaterial scaffolds, exogenous cells,
  and soluble regulators for the formation of tissue in vitro (TE) and regeneration
  of tissues/organs in vivo (regenerative medicine / OR). The course describes the
  methodologies for producing biomaterial scaffolds to accommodate the infiltration
  of endogenous cells (e.g., for the treatment of stroke) and for delivering cells
  and regulatory molecules (e.g., for the treatment of blindness). Examples of clinical
  successes and failures of regenerative devices are analyzed as case studies.
