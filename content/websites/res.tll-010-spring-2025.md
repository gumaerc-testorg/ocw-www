course_description: "The syllabus informs students' first impressions of a class,\
  \ the instructor, and their evaluation of whether they will succeed. Given the important\
  \ role of the syllabus for students and for instructors\u2019 intentional design\
  \ of the course, this syllabus checklist is a tool to guide instructors in their\
  \ construction and revision of course design, assessment descriptions, teaching\
  \ practices, and policies in their syllabi. Many of the checklist items also apply\
  \ beyond the syllabus to other communication channels in the course (e.g., Learning\
  \ Management Systems, course wikis, classroom conversations).\n\nThe checklist is\
  \ adapted from a comprehensive and detailed rubric developed by members of MIT's\
  \ [Teaching + Learning Lab](https://tll.mit.edu/)."
