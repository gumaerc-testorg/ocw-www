course_description: "One mind, two languages. The basic focus of this class will be\
  \ on the linguistic and psycholinguistic underpinnings of the bilingual brain, seeking\
  \ to understand what it means to \u201Cacquire\u201D a new language. How did we\
  \ learn our first language(s)?\_Were we taught English? Japanese? Chinese? Spanish?\
  \ If so, how did we do it so quickly or so slowly? Is the learning of a new target\
  \ language different from the learning of a first language? Is there a critical\
  \ period for language learning? To answer these questions, we will consider topics\
  \ including different models of bilingualism, how it is possible to make grammaticality\
  \ judgments about code-switches, how bilingualism affects other domains of human\
  \ cognition, and what imaging studies of the human brain tell us about the bilingual/multilingual\
  \ brain."
