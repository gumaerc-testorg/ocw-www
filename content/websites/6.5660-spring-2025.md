course_description: 'This course covers design and implementation of secure computer
  systems. The lectures cover attacks that compromise security as well as techniques
  for achieving security, based on recent research papers. Topics include operating
  system security, privilege separation, capabilities, language-based security, cryptographic
  network protocols, trusted hardware, and security in web applications and mobile
  phones. The labs involve implementing and compromising a web application that sandboxes
  arbitrary code, supporting TLS certificates, and adding two-factor authentication.
