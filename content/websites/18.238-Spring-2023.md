course_description: The main goal of this course is to present the basic ideas of
  quantum field theory (QFT) in a completely rigorous and mathematical way. Topics
  of the course include generalities on classical and quantum mechanics and field
  theory, 0-dimensional QFT, 1-dimensional QFT, *d*\-dimensional QFT, supergeometry
  and field theories with fermions, and an introduction to 2-dimensional conformal
  field theory.
