course_description: "The central concern of this class is the historical relationship\
  \ between the social lives of everyday people and U.S. American poetics, with a\
  \ special emphasis on what June Jordan once termed the \u201Cdifficult miracle of\
  \ Black poetry in America.\u201D How does poetry help us to know one another? And\
  \ how might we better understand the particular role of poetry, of poiesis, for\
  \ those historically barred from the very practice of reading or writing, from ownership\
  \ (even of one\u2019s own body), and various generally recognized forms of belonging?\
  \ For this course, these will be some of our animating questions."
