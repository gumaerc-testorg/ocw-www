course_description: 'This course discusses the dynamics of the atmosphere, with emphasis
  on the large scale. Topics include internal gravity waves in the atmosphere; potential
  vorticity conservation and Rossby waves; baroclinic instability and extratropical
  storms; the general circulation including the role of eddies, isentropic coordinates
  and tracer transport.


  This class builds on a previous version of 12.810 taught by Professor Alan Plumb.'
