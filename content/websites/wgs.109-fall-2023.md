course_description: 'This course explores theoretical issues and concerns underlying
  global feminisms, and their expression through diverse forms of feminist activism
  at the community, national, and transnational levels. A comparative perspective
  is used to examine the following questions: How are women''s issues understood and
  articulated in different contexts? What are the linkages between women''s multiple
  identities (class, race, caste, ethnicity, religion, location) and feminist activism?
  How do conflict, religious fundamentalism, and militarization of societies impact
  women''s lives? Further, the course explores the role of the state in influencing
  the course and direction of women''s movements, and women''s mobilization within
  and across national boundaries for social and gender justice. The challenges and
  dilemmas facing contemporary women''s activism are also addressed.


  In this semester the course will devote a section of the course to the Black Lives
  Matter struggle in the US and its global impact.'
