course_description: "The goal of these lectures is to provide an introduction to Fourier\
  \ analysis. The first topic is Fourier series, in particular, the Gibbs phenomenon\
  \ and the dependence of their convergence properties on the suitability method used.\
  \ The second topic is the Fourier transform, first the *L*\xB9 theory and then,\
  \ using Hermite functions, the *L*\xB2 theory. The third topic is L. Schwartz's\
  \ theory of tempered distributions. The fourth topic is the theory of weak convergence\
  \ of probability measures and application to a derivation of the L\xE9vy-Khinchine\
  \ formula for the Fourier transform of infinitely divisible probability measures.\
  \ The final topic is the elementary theory of singular integral operators, starting\
  \ with the Hilbert transform and then using the method of rations to prove the *L*\u1D56\
  \ boundedness of even Calder\xF2n-Zygmund kernels."
