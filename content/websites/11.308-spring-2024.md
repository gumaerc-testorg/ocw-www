course_description: 'Ecological urbanism weds the theory and practice of city design
  and planning, as a means of adaptation, with the insights of ecology (the study
  of the relationships among living organisms and their environment and the processes
  that shape both) and other environmental disciplines. Ecological urbanism is critical
  to the future of the city and its design: it provides a framework for addressing
  challenges that threaten humanity, such as climate change, rising sea level, declining
  oil reserves, rising energy demands, and environmental and social injustice, while
  fulfilling human needs for health, safety, welfare, meaning, and delight.'
