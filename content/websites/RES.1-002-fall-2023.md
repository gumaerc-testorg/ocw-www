course_description: The goal of these videos is to provide students with tools and
  concepts for working with R, a free software environment for statistical computing
  and graphics. The students will learn the basics of R, how to navigate the R interface
  and deal with different data formats, how to run and interpret linear models with
  R, and how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R. These practical sessions
  were developed as part of the course *1.845 Terrestrial Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem
  Ecology* but will be useful for anyone looking to learn about R and GIS.
