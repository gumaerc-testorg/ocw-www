course_description: "This course examines and experiments with pathways to decarbonization\
  \ at the million-person scale.\_Our field site is Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\u2014the\
  \ coldest capital on Earth and one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities, largely\
  \ as a result of coal combustion.\_We will explore the design and implementation\
  \ of a molten salt heat bank to be used as an alternative to coal for household\
  \ heating.\_Our approach is holistic and interdisciplinary: to prototype a locally\
  \ specific, culturally acceptable, and socio-economically viable reusable energy\
  \ source, we combine anthropology and engineering to understand and address the\
  \ complex social, environmental, material, economic, and political conditions that\
  \ shape energy and sustainability dilemmas in Ulaanbaatar.\_In doing so, we will\
  \ move back and forth between prototyping the heat bank and considering practical\
  \ constraints specific to the place and people."
