course_description: "This four-part dinner series was created by Prof. Lawrence Susskind\
  \ at the request of a group of students in MIT's Department of Urban Studies and\
  \ Planning ([DUSP](https://dusp.mit.edu/)) who felt the need for a graduate-level\
  \ leadership course that would be attuned specifically to the needs of public sector\
  \ professionals.\n\nThe trailer and session videos may be freely viewed, downloaded,\
