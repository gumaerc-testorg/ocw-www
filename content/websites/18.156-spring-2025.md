course_description: "The class studies projection theory, starting from the first\
  \ questions and building up to recent developments.\_ Projection theory studies\
  \ how a set *X* behaves under different orthogonal projections. Questions of this\
  \ type aren't usually emphasized in the graduate analysis curriculum, but they come\
  \ up in many areas of math, including harmonic analysis, analytic number theory,\
  \ additive combinatorics, and homogeneous dynamics.\n\nWe will survey several applications\
  \ of projection theory. For each topic, we will introduce and motivate the topic\
  \ and see how it connects with projection theory. We will prove something about\
  \ each topic but not necessarily the strongest results."
