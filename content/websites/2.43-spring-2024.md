course_description: "This course is a self-contained concise review of general thermodynamics\
  \ concepts, multicomponent equilibrium properties, chemical equilibrium, electrochemical\
  \ potentials, and chemical kinetics, as needed to introduce the methods of nonequilibrium\
  \ thermodynamics and to provide a unified understanding of phase equilibria, transport,\
  \ and nonequilibrium phenomena useful for future energy and climate engineering\
  \ technologies. Applications include second-law efficiencies and methods to allocate\
  \ primary energy consumptions and CO\u2082 emissions in cogeneration and hybrid\
  \ power systems, minimum work of separation, maximum work of mixing, osmotic pressure\
  \ and membrane equilibria, metastable states, spinodal decomposition, and Onsager\u2019\
  s near-equilibrium reciprocity in thermodiffusive, thermoelectric, and electrokinetic\
  \ cross effects."
