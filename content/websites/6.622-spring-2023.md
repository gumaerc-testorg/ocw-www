course_description: "6.622 covers modeling, analysis, design, control, and application\
  \ of circuits for energy conversion and control. As described by the Institute of\
  \ Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), power electronics technology \"encompasses\
  \ the use of electronic components, the application of circuit theory and design\
  \ techniques, and the development of analytical tools toward efficient electronic\
  \ conversion, control, and conditioning of electric power.\"\_Students taking this\
  \ class will come away with an understanding of the fundamental principles of power\
  \ electronics, and knowledge of how to both analyze and design power electronic\
  \ components and systems."
