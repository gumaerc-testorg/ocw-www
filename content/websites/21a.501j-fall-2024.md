course_description: This course examines how people learn, practice, and evaluate
  traditional and contemporary craft techniques. Social science theories of design,
  embodiment, apprenticeship learning, skill, labor, expertise, and tacit knowledge
  are used to explore distinctions among art, craft, and science. It also discusses
  the commoditization of craft into market goods, collectible art, and tourism industries.
  Ethnographic and historical case studies include textiles, Shaker furniture, glassblowing,
  quilting, cheesemaking, industrial design, home and professional cooking, factory
  and laboratory work, CAD/CAM. Demonstrations, optional field trips, and/or hands-on
  craft projects may be included.
