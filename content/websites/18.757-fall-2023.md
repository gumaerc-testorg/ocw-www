course_description: "The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the representation\
  \ theory of compact and non-compact Lie groups. It will rely on some material from\
  \ [*18.745 Lie Groups and Lie Algebras I*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-745-lie-groups-and-lie-algebras-i-fall-2020/)\
  \ and [*18.755 Lie Groups and Lie Algebras II*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-755-lie-groups-and-lie-algebras-ii-spring-2024/),\
  \ but full familiarity with this material is not required. Topics include continuous\
  \ representations; algebras of measures on a Lie group; K-finite, smooth, and analytic\
  \ vectors; admissible representations; unitary representations; the Harish-Chandra\
  \ admissibility and analyticity theorems; (g,K)-modules; infinitesimal equivalence\
  \ and realizations; Harish-Chandra\u2019s globalization theorem; representations\
  \ of SL(2,R), the Chevalley restriction theorem; the Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem;\
  \ Kostant\u2019s theorem; Harish-Chandra isomorphism; Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand\
  \ category O; projective functors; classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra\
  \ bimodules; the nilpotent cone; the Duflo-Joseph theorem; Duflo\u2019s primitive\
  \ ideal theorem; the Borel-Weil theorem; Springer resolution; Beilinson-Bernstein\
  \ localization; D-modules; and classification of representations of a semisimple\
  \ real group in terms of the orbits of the complexified maximal compact subgroup\
  \ on the flag variety."
