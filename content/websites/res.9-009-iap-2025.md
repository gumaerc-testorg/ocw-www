course_description: "In this course, you will learn the basics of computational neuroscience\
  \ via hands-on model building in Neuroblox and Julia. You will simulate models from\
  \ the literature, from single neurons to large circuits with synaptic plasticity,\
  \ and fit them to neural data. By the end of the course, you will be able to model\
  \ your data, build your own custom circuit \u201Cblox\u201D that may be incorporated\
  \ into the Neuroblox library, and explore how interventions such as drugs and stimulation\
  \ probes affect neural circuits.\n\nComputational neuroscience aims to simulate\
  \ the brain *in silico*, from single synapses to brain-wide networks. The field\
  \ has matured in tandem with experimental neuroscience, to the point where computational\
  \ modeling has become an indispensable tool for understanding neuroscience data\
  \ and motivating future experiments. However, building such models can involve a\
  \ painstaking process of translating concepts from the literature into working code,\
  \ then optimizing it to run in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nNeuroblox is a new software\
  \ platform for computational neuroscience that aims to break down these barriers.\
  \ It is based on the Julia programming language, built with simplicity, modularity,\
  \ and performance in mind. It consists of a library of modular computational building\
  \ blocks (\u201Cblox\u201D) that can be easily assembled to simulate brain dynamics\
  \ in code or via an easy-to-use graphical interface. Our tools bridge scales from\
  \ spiking neurons to brain waves and fMRI, and have applications to neurology and\
  \ psychiatry. Moreover, the behavior of multiple model variants can be compared\
  \ to discriminate between competing hypotheses.\n\nTo learn more about computational\
  \ neuroscience and the team's research, visit the [Laboratory for Computational\
  \ Neurodiagnostics website](https://www.lcneuro.org/).\n\n**Course Audience:**\_\
  Anyone interested in exploring how the brain works, including how it leads to cognition.\_\
  \n\n**Course Prerequisites:** Prior coding experience is beneficial but not necessary.\n\
  \n**Course Structure:**\_Brief presentation of background material,\_followed by\
  \ hands-on exercises and open-ended challenges."
