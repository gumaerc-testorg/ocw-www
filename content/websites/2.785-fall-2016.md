course_description: This course teaches the effects of mechanical forces (strains)
  on cells and how cells generate mechanical forces by their contraction. Critical
  to both topics is the mechanical behavior of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which
  the cells have synthesized and remodeled. The ECM affects cell behavior by mediating
  exogenous mechanical strains, which stimulate certain cellular processes.
