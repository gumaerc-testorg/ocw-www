course_description: 'This course dives into advanced concepts in computer vision.
  A first focus is geometry in computer vision, including image formation, representation
  theory for vision, classic multi-view geometry, multi-view geometry in the age of
  deep learning, differentiable rendering, neural scene representations, correspondence
  estimation, optical flow computation, and point tracking.


  Next, we explore generative modeling and representation learning including image
  and video generation, guidance in diffusion models, and conditional probabilistic
  models, as well as representation learning in the form of contrastive and masking-based
  methods.


  Finally, we will explore the intersection of robotics and computer vision with "vision
  for embodied agents," investigating the role of vision for decision-making, planning
  and control.'
