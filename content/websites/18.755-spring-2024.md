course_description: This course is the second half of the year-long introductory graduate
  sequence [*Lie Groups and Lie Algebras I*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-745-lie-groups-and-lie-algebras-i-fall-2020/)
  *& Lie Groups and Lie Algebras II*. Topics include classical groups, Haar measure
  on locally compact groups, the representation-theoretic understanding of the hydrogen
  atom, representations of compact (in particular, finite) groups, the Peter-Weyl
  theorem with proof, maximal tori, Cartan and Iwasawa decompositions, classification
  of real reductive Lie groups, topology of Lie groups, proof of the third fundamental
  theorem of Lie theory, Levi decomposition, Ado's theorem, Borel subgroups, and flag
  manifolds.
