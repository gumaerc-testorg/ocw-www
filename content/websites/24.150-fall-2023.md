course_description: "This course examines\_theories and principles that\_underlie\
  \ the concept of free speech\_in the United States, the historical context in which\
  \ the values of free speech and toleration emerged,\_and the\_philosophical arguments\_\
  that were and are\_made for and against them. Students analyze a\_variety of\_contexts\
  \ and communicative practices, including\_new media technologies,\_to\_debate how\
  \ \"speech\" can be described and when it should be appropriately regulated.\_The\
  \ course also considers current disputes over free speech on\_college campuses."
