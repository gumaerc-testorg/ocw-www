  \ of linguistics whose goal is to understand how humans acquire the ability to speak\
  \ and understand a language\u2014a highly complex task that is routinely and seemingly\
  \ effortlessly accomplished by competent (native) speakers of the language in the\
  \ first few years of life and without explicit instruction. By contrast, acquiring\
  \ a second language after the critical period takes a long time, is effortful, usually\
  \ requires explicit instruction and correction, and often fails to reach a level\
  \ of competency that native speakers of the language have.\n\nFocusing on first\
  \ language acquisition\u2014the process by which native speakers of a language acquire\
  \ the ability to speak and understand that language\u2014this course covers selected\
  \ topics in core areas of linguistic knowledge, including the lexicon (words), sentence\
  \ structure, meaning composition, and pragmatics, from a developmental perspective."
