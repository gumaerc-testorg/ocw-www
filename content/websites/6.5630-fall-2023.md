course_description: "This course is about the\_evolution\_of\_proofs\_in computer\
  \ science.\_We will learn about the power of interactive\_proofs, multi-prover interactive\_\
  proofs,\_and probabilistically checkable\_proofs.\_ We will then show how to use\
  \ cryptography to convert these powerful\_proof\_systems into computationally\_\
  sound non-interactive arguments (SNARGs)."
