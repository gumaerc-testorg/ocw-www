course_description: "The MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative\u2019s Climate, Environment,\
  \ and Sustainability Infusion Fellowship (CESIF) launched in February 2023 to empower\
  \ faculty across MIT to cross their disciplinary boundaries and embed topics of\
  \ climate science, the environment, and sustainability (CES) into the regular undergraduate\
  \ curriculum.\n\nBy infusing CES (climate, environment, and sustainability) topics\
  \ into regular undergraduate subjects, MIT students were introduced to the critical\
  \ challenges facing society today and the pathways toward planetary sustainability\
  \ tomorrow.\n\nThe Fellowship had a duration of two years, continuing until the\
  \ spring of 2025. It provided faculty with funding and opportunities to build community\
  \ in a cohort of faculty and instructors across disciplines, to engage in monthly\
  \ meetings to learn about innovative CES content knowledge and pedagogical methodologies,\
  \ to work with CES area experts and speakers, to workshop new instructional material,\
  \ to get feedback from peers and ESI staff and visiting experts, to work closely\
  \ with peer fellows for additional accountability and feedback, and to have access\
  \ to a shared online platform for instructional support."
