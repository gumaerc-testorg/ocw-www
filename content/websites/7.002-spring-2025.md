course_description: 7.002 is a laboratory course that teaches fundamental skills for
  performing biological research. Through experiments with an *E. coli* bacterial
  ATPase called ClpX, you will learn essential molecular biology techniques commonly
  used in modern research labs. These techniques include site-directed mutagenesis,
  DNA isolation, molecular cloning, bacteria transformations, recombinant protein
  expression and purification, gel electrophoresis, and western blotting. Learning
  these techniques will give you a taste of life in a molecular biochemistry lab and
  prepare you for future research work. Our focus is on helping you integrate factual
  knowledge with an understanding of experimental design and data analysis.
