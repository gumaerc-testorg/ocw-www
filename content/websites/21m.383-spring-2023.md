course_description: This course presents major approaches to computational music theory
  and musicology in the symbolic (score-based) domain. It covers algorithms for music
  theory, encoding, corpus studies, musical search and similarity, feature extraction
  and machine learning, music generation, and computational music perception. Other
  topics include repertory access and computational bias. Programming assignments
  are in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the MIT-created [music21 toolkit.](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/)
