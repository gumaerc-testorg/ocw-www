  cryptocurrency, blockchain, tokenization, platforms and computational algorithms
  with the economics tools of contract theory, mechanism design, general equilibrium
  theory, and monetary theory. The goal is to understand the assumptions, existing
  shortcomings, and potential impact on legacy systems of distributed ledgers, smart
  contracts, and encryption and to explore possibilities for new financial designs
  and for regulation.
