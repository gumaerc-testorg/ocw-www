course_description: 'This course introduces skills and capabilities for real-world
  problem solving to take technology from lab to societal impact: technical and functional
  exploration, opportunity discovery, market understanding, value economics, scale-up,
  intellectual property, and communicating/working for impact across disciplines.
  Students work in multidisciplinary teams formed around MIT research breakthroughs,
  with extensive in-class coaching and guidance from faculty, lab members, and select
  mentors. It follows a structured approach to innovating in which everything is a
  variable, and the product, technology, and opportunities for new ventures can be
  seen as an act of synthesis. Teams gather evidence that permits a fact-based iteration
  across multiple application domains, markets, functionalities, technologies, and
  products, leading to a recommendation that maps a space of opportunity and includes
  actionable next steps to evolve the market and technology.'
