course_description: This is a fast-paced introduction to Deep Learning with an emphasis
  on developing a practical understanding of how to build models to solve complex
  problems involving unstructured data. Topics include the basics of deep neural networks
  and how to set up and train them, convolutional networks to process images and videos,
  transformers for natural language processing, generative large language models (such
  as ChatGPT), and text-to-image models (such as MidJourney). Prior familiarity with
  Python and fundamental machine learning concepts (such as training/validation/testing,
  overfitting/underfitting, and regularization) is required.
