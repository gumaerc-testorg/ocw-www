course_description: This seminar is an invitation to sociolinguistics and postcolonial
  linguistics with case studies from Haiti, Palestine, and Israel. We will examine
  the exclusion vs. inclusion of certain languages and their speakers in avenues where
  knowledge and power are created and transmitted. Additionally, we will explore the
  use of language and linguistics in propaganda in the context of conflicts where
  words, definitions, phrases, syntactic patterns, etc., are enlisted to political
  ends to the detriment of academic freedom, freedom of speech, mutual understanding,
  empathy, peace, community building, social justice, etc.
