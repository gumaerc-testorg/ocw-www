course_description: "This course gives an introduction to analysis, and the goal is\
  \ twofold:\_\_\n\n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_1. To learn how to prove mathematical theorems in\
  \ analysis and how to write proofs.\_\_\_\_  \n\_ \_ \_ \_ \_2. To prove theorems\
  \ in calculus in a rigorous way.\n\nThe course will start with real numbers, limits,\
  \ convergence, series and\_continuity.\_ We will continue on with metric spaces,\
  \ differentiation and\_ Riemann integrals.\_ After that, we will move on to\_differential\
  \ equations."
