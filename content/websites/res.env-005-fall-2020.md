course_description: 'The goal of the Climate Primer website is to summarize the most
  important lines of evidence for human-caused climate change. It confronts the stickier
  questions about uncertainty in our projections, engages in a discussion of risk
  and risk managment, and concludes by presenting different options for taking action.
  We hope that the facts prepare you for more effective conversations with your community
  about values, trade-offs, politics, and actions.


  In March 2024, the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative launched the first major
  update to the Climate Primer. The updated Primer includes more precise estimates
  of future global warming and its effects on global temperatures and extreme weather
  events, important advances in climate modeling, new actions taken around the world
  to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and the latest data about the pace at
  which clean energy and other critical climate solutions are being deployed. [Read
  more about the update on the MIT Environmental Solutions website](https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/news/a-refreshed-mit-climate-primer-to-better-serve-students-educators-and-the-climate-curious/).'
