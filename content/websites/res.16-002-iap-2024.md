course_description: "Have you ever wondered how objects from our daily lives are designed?\
  \ How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a\
  \ Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet engine? A test dummy?\
  \ How about making an animation of a LEGO house building itself? Or making a realistic\
  \ render of a bowl of fruit? In this workshop, you will learn skills to design all\
  \ these and much more!\n\nHow to CAD Almost Anything introduces students to CAD\
  \ (Computer-Aided Design) through various fun examples focused on reverse engineering.\
  \ In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop emphasizes\
  \ the design process itself, understanding how to plan and best leverage our available\
  \ tools to arrive at our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following\
  \ the instructions on an engineering drawing and more about independent thinking\
  \ and strategizing, such as reverse engineering an object into a 3D model.\n\nCome\
  \ and learn how to CAD almost anything!\n\nThis supplemental resource offers links\
