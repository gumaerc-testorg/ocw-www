course_description: This is a course on the design and implementation of operating
  systems and their use as a foundation for systems programming. Topics covered include
  virtual memory; file systems; threads; context switches; kernels; interrupts; system
  calls; and interprocess communication, coordination, and interaction between software
  and hardware. A multi-processor operating system for RISC-V, xv6, is used to illustrate
  these topics. Individual laboratory assignments involve extending the xv6 operating
  system, for example to support sophisticated virtual memory features and networking.
